# Player Identifiers

An identifier is a string signature filled in by the player and stored in the replay. In Minesweeper Arbiter, it is called "player identity". In MetaSweeper settings, it is called "identifier".

## Managing identifiers on Open Minesweeper

The identifier management area is at the bottom of the **Overview** tab on your profile page. You can add or delete your identifiers there. After you add or delete an identifier, all replays with the corresponding identifier are refreshed, mainly including leaderboard eligibility checks.

## Tournament identifiers

Tournament identifiers prove that a replay was created after a tournament started. When a tournament starts, the system generates a random identifier. During the tournament, only replays containing that tournament identifier are automatically recognized as tournament replays.

## FAQ

### Why did my record not update after I uploaded a replay?

You can view all your replays in the **Videos** tab on your profile page. If a replay's status is "identifier mismatch", it is not included in record statistics. You need to register the corresponding identifier, and then the replay will enter record statistics.

### I already registered the identifier. Why does the replay still say "identifier mismatch"?

Open Minesweeper uses exact string matching for identifiers. Some strings may look identical but are actually different, causing a mismatch. The most common causes are:

- Spaces and other invisible characters
- Chinese and English punctuation differences

The identifier management page has a copy button for registered identifiers. You can copy the registered identifier and compare it in another program.

### Why did adding an identifier fail?

1. You do not have any replay with that identifier. When you use a new identifier, you must first upload at least one replay containing it, and then add the identifier.
2. The identifier is already used by another user.
